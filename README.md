# NY-Housing-MLP
In this project, I implemented a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) from scratch, without using any machine learning libraries, to solve a classification task on real-world data from the New York housing market. The goal was to predict the number of bedrooms in a property based on various features such as broker title, property type, price, and more. The MLP was designed to handle both numeric and text-based inputs, with custom encoding strategies for the latter. This project involved extensive hyperparameter tuning and performance evaluation against a benchmark model to achieve high classification accuracy. The final model demonstrated strong predictive capabilities and provided valuable insights into the New York housing market.
